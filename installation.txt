Installation

Download the latest version of the Unit Tests distribution and unzip to a directory on your system, such as

    ~/Dev

This will create a folder like this

    ~/Dev/PureMVC_ObjectiveC_UnitTests_X_Y

Where X_Y is the unit tests version number.

Inside you will find

    * The source code: src/org/puremvc/objectivec/...
    * The PureMVC static library used by the unit tests: lib/PureMVC/PureMVC_ObjectiveC_X_Y.a
    * The PureMVC header files used by the unit tests: lib/PureMVC/headers
